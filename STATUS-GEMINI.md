# Project Status Report - Gemini CLI

## Overall Status

The project has a solid architectural foundation with a microservices setup, Docker containerization, and a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. The Payment Service and PDF Generation Service have been implemented, and the core logic for the Calculation Service is in place. The Docker Compose environment is now successfully bringing up all services, including the database and Etcd.

## Completed Tasks

*   **Project Reorganization:**
    *   Moved services into a `services/` directory.
    *   Moved documentation into a `docs/` directory.
*   **Payment Microservice Implementation:**
    *   Implemented `POST /api/checkout` (Stripe Checkout Session creation).
    *   Implemented `POST /webhooks/stripe` (webhook verification, database update).
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` for non-root user and dependencies.
    *   Created `requirements.txt`.
    *   Updated `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
    *   Reviewed for GDPR/SOC/PCI compliance and applied enhancements.
*   **Database Setup:**
    *   Created `db/` directory with `schema.sql` (PostgreSQL/PostGIS tables).
    *   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include `db` service, mount `schema.sql`, and update service build paths/dependencies.
    *   Initialized Alembic for database migrations.
    *   Configured `db/alembic.ini` and `db/migrations/env.py` for environment variable-based database connection.
    *   Created initial Alembic migration script.
    *   Created `db/TODO.md` and `db/CODINGPLAN.md`.
*   **Calculation Microservice Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Implemented `POST /api/calculate` (LIDAR parsing with `laspy`, basic solar simulation with `pvlib`, database interaction).
    *   Created `requirements.txt`.
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` for non-root user and dependencies.
    *   Updated `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
*   **PDF Generation Microservice Implementation:**
    *   Implemented `GET /api/download/:project_id` (data retrieval, Jinja2 templating, WeasyPrint PDF rendering).
    *   Created `requirements.txt`.
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` for non-root user, Python, and system dependencies.
    *   Created `templates/report_template.html`.
    *   Updated `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
*   **API Gateway (APISIX) Setup:**
    *   Added `etcd` service to `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Configured `api-gateway/config.yaml` to point to `etcd`.
    *   Updated `api-gateway/Dockerfile` to explicitly set `APISIX_ETCD_HOST`.
*   **Documentation & Configuration:**
    *   Created global and service-specific `.gitignore` files.
    *   Updated global `TODO.md` and `CODINGPLAN.md`.
    *   Created service-specific `TODO.md` and `CODINGPLAN.md` for all microservices.
    *   Created `.env` file in the project root.

## Pending Tasks & Challenges Encountered

*   **Database Migration Application:** The initial Alembic migration has been created but not yet applied to the running database instance. This is crucial for formal schema management.
*   **Calculation Service Tests:** Unit tests for the calculation service are currently failing due to complex mocking issues with `laspy` and `pvlib` libraries. This needs to be resolved to ensure code quality and reliability.
*   **Frontend Implementation:** The frontend is still a basic placeholder without the wizard UI or 3D visualization.
*   **API Gateway (APISIX) Configuration:** While the service is running, full routing and payment gating logic in APISIX still needs to be implemented and verified.
*   **CORS Configuration:** CORS is not yet configured, which will be necessary for frontend-backend communication.
*   **Authentication/User Management:** No user management or session handling is implemented.
*   **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Basic logging is in place, but a centralized and robust observability solution is needed.
*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** While basic validation exists, more comprehensive input validation and sanitization are required across all services.
*   **Secrets Management:** For production, a more robust secrets management solution than `.env` files is needed.

## Next Steps

Based on the current status and the user's emphasis on completing the database setup, the immediate next steps are:

1.  **Apply Initial Alembic Migration:**
    *   Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the initial database schema using Alembic. This will ensure the database is properly versioned.
2.  **Verify Database Schema:**
    *   Connect to the running PostgreSQL database (e.g., using `psql` or a GUI tool) and confirm that the `projects` and `calculations` tables, along with their columns and extensions, are correctly created.
3.  **Verify Service Database Connectivity:**
    *   Run health checks for the `payment-service`, `calculation-service`, and `pdf-generation-service` to confirm they can successfully connect to the database.
4.  **Address Calculation Service Test Failures:**
    *   Revisit and resolve the mocking issues in `services/calculation-service/tests/test_app.py` to get all tests passing.
5.  **Implement API Gateway Routing and Payment Gating:**
    *   Configure APISIX to correctly route requests to all microservices.
    *   Implement the payment gating logic for the PDF download endpoint.
6.  **Implement CORS:**
    *   Configure CORS headers, likely within the API Gateway.
