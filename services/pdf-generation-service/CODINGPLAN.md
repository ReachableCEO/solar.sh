# PDF Generation Service Coding Plan

This file outlines the development plan for the PDF Generation Service.

## Phase 1: Data Retrieval and Basic Templating

*   **Objective:** Successfully retrieve data and create a basic HTML report.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement functions to connect to the PostgreSQL database and fetch project details, calculation results, and any other necessary metadata for a given `project_id`.
    *   Set up a basic Jinja2 environment.
    *   Create a simple HTML template that displays key information from the retrieved data.
    *   Ensure data is correctly passed from the Python application to the Jinja2 template.

## Phase 2: PDF Rendering Integration

*   **Objective:** Convert the HTML report into a PDF document.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Integrate WeasyPrint (or a similar library) into the service.
    *   Develop a function to render the generated HTML into a PDF.
    *   Configure basic PDF settings (e.g., page size, margins).
    *   Ensure fonts and images are correctly embedded in the PDF.

## Phase 3: Advanced Templating and Report Features

*   **Objective:** Enhance the visual quality and content of the PDF reports.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Refine HTML/CSS templates to match desired report design, including charts, graphs, and detailed tables.
    *   Implement conditional rendering of sections based on available data.
    *   Add dynamic elements like page numbers, dates, and project-specific headers/footers.
    *   Optimize CSS for print media to ensure consistent rendering across different PDF viewers.

## Phase 4: API and Integration

*   **Objective:** Expose the PDF generation functionality via an API and ensure seamless integration.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement the `GET /api/download/:project_id` endpoint.
    *   Ensure the endpoint correctly triggers the data retrieval, templating, and PDF rendering pipeline.
    *   Set appropriate HTTP headers for file download (`Content-Disposition`, `Content-Type`).
    *   Implement robust error handling for data retrieval, templating, and rendering failures.
