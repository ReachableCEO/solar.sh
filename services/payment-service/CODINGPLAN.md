# Payment Service Coding Plan

This file outlines the development plan for the Payment Service.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)

*   **Objective:** Implement the primary payment processing flow and Stripe integration.
*   **Status:** Core implementation is complete. The service successfully:
    *   Creates Stripe Checkout Sessions via `POST /api/checkout`.
    *   Handles Stripe webhooks (`POST /webhooks/stripe`), specifically `checkout.session.completed` events.
    *   Verifies webhook signatures for security.
    *   Updates the `projects` table in the PostgreSQL database to mark projects as 'paid'.
    *   Includes a `/health` endpoint for basic health checks.
    *   Has been reviewed and enhanced for security and compliance best practices (non-root user in Docker, configurable URLs, mandatory price ID).

## Phase 2: Ongoing Maintenance and Minor Enhancements

*   **Objective:** Ensure the service remains robust, secure, and efficient.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Continuously monitor logs and performance metrics.
    *   Address any identified bugs or vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   Implement minor feature requests or refinements as needed (e.g., more granular error handling, connection pooling).
    *   Keep dependencies updated.

## Phase 3: Integration and Deployment Support

*   **Objective:** Facilitate seamless integration with other services and robust deployment.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Provide clear documentation and support for frontend integration.
    *   Collaborate on setting up secure secrets management in production environments.
    *   Assist with CI/CD pipeline integration and deployment automation.
