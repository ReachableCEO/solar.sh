# Payment Service TODO List

This file tracks specific tasks for the Payment Service.

## Minor Enhancements & Refinements

*   **Error Handling:** Review and enhance error handling for Stripe API calls and database interactions to provide more specific feedback and logging.
*   **Logging:** Implement more detailed logging for webhook events and payment status updates, ensuring no sensitive data is logged.
*   **Database Connection Pooling:** For high-traffic scenarios, consider implementing a database connection pool to optimize resource usage.
*   **Stripe Event Handling:** Add more specific handling for other relevant Stripe webhook events beyond `checkout.session.completed` if business logic requires (e.g., refunds, disputes).

## Security & Compliance

*   **Secrets Management:** Integrate with a robust secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production credentials.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly review and update Python dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and leverage new features.

## Documentation

*   Keep `README.md` updated with any changes to environment variables, API endpoints, or deployment instructions.
