# Solar Calculator Inputs

Based on the research, the following are the key inputs for a solar calculator:

## Primary Inputs

*   **Electricity Consumption:** Average monthly or yearly electricity usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh). This is the most critical input.
*   **Location:** Address or Zip Code to determine the amount of sunlight (peak sun hours).
*   **Roof Characteristics:**
    *   **Available Area:** Total square footage of the roof suitable for panel installation.
    *   **Orientation and Pitch:** The direction the roof faces (e.g., south) and its angle.
    *   **Shading:** Any obstructions that cast shadows on the roof.

## Secondary and Advanced Inputs

*   **Utility Provider:** To calculate savings based on electricity rates and net metering policies.
*   **System and Equipment Choices:**
    *   **Panel Wattage:** The power output of individual solar panels (e.g., 250-400 watts).
    *   **Inverter Type:** The efficiency of the inverter.
    *   **Solar Batteries:** If the user wants to store excess energy.
*   **Future Energy Needs:** Any planned changes that will increase electricity consumption (e.g., electric vehicle).
