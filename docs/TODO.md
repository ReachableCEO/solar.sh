# Project TODO List

This file tracks the remaining tasks for the Sol-Calc project.

## ARCHITECTURE ALERT

*   The API Gateway was changed from APISIX to Nginx without authorization. This needs to be reverted.
*   The payment gating logic was incorrectly implemented in the `pdf-generation-service` instead of the API Gateway. This needs to be corrected.

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

*   **PDF Generation Service:**
    *   ✅ Core functionality is implemented with extensive tests.
    *   ❌ **NEEDS FIXING:** Payment gating logic must be removed from this service and moved to the API Gateway.

*   **Calculation Service:**
    *   ✅ Basic Flask application structure implemented.
    *   ✅ LIDAR data parsing framework (laspy integration).
    *   ❌ Complete solar modeling algorithms (PVLib integration, energy yield, shading analysis).
    *   ❌ Enhanced calculation result persistence and processing.

*   **Payment Service:**
    *   ✅ Basic Flask application structure implemented.
    *   ❌ Complete Stripe integration for checkout and webhooks.
    *   ❌ Payment status tracking and database integration.

*   **Frontend Service:**
    *   ✅ Basic React application structure implemented.
    *   ✅ Build process and serving configuration completed.
    *   ❌ Multi-step data wizard UI implementation.
    *   ❌ 3D visualizer (three.js) for LIDAR data and panel positioning.

## ❌ TODO - Backend

*   **API Gateway (APISIX):**
    *   ❌ Revert the unauthorized Nginx implementation back to the planned APISIX gateway.
    *   ❌ Implement payment gating logic in the API gateway.
    *   ❌ Configure routing for all services.

*   **Database & Schema:**
    *   ❌ Apply the initial Alembic migration to the database.

## ❌ TODO - Frontend Development

*   Design and implement the multi-step data wizard UI (React/Vue).
*   Integrate 3D visualizer (three.js) for LIDAR data and panel positioning.
*   Implement asynchronous processing feedback and status polling.
*   Integrate with `/api/checkout` for payment flow.
*   Implement PDF download functionality through frontend.

## ❌ TODO - Advanced Features

*   **Secrets Management (Vault):**
    *   Enable AppRole Auth Method.
    *   Create a Policy for the Application.
    *   Create the AppRole.
    *   Get the RoleID and SecretID.
    *   Create the Secrets (database credentials, Stripe API keys).

## ❌ TODO - Quality Assurance & Operations

*   ✅ Basic unit tests implemented for PDF service (15 tests passing).
*   ❌ Comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests for all services.
*   ❌ Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
*   ❌ Conduct security audits and penetration testing.
*   ❌ Perform performance testing and optimization.
*   ❌ Establish robust logging, monitoring, and alerting systems.
*   ✅ GDPR compliance implemented in PDF service (data export/deletion).
